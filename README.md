# Social Media Engagement Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
Rohan is an aspiring content creator who is active on multiple social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. Despite posting consistently, he struggles to decide which type of content (video, image, reel, story, etc.) performs best on each platform. As a result, his likes, shares and comments growth are not improving as expected. The challenge is to analyze Rohanâ€™s past 2023 data of social media performance data to identify. By solving this problem, Rohan can create a clear strategy to post the right content on the right platform, leading to faster growth in likes, comments, shares, and followers.
