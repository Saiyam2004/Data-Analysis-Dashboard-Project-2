# Social Media Engagement Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
Rohan is an aspiring content creator who is active on multiple social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. Despite posting consistently, he struggles to decide which type of content (video, image, reel, story, etc.) performs best on each platform. As a result, the growth of his likes, shares, and comments has not improved as expected.

The challenge is to analyze Rohanâ€™s 2023 social media performance data to identify the key problems affecting his engagement. By solving this, Rohan can develop a clear strategy to post the right content on the right platform, leading to faster growth in likes, comments, shares, and followers.
