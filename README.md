# Social Media Engagement Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
Rohan is an aspiring content creator who is active on multiple social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. Despite posting consistently, he struggles to decide which type of content (video, image, reel, story, etc.) performs best on each platform. As a result, the growth of his likes, shares, and comments has not improved as expected.

The challenge is to analyze Rohan’s 2023 social media performance data to identify the key problems affecting his engagement. By solving this, Rohan can develop a clear strategy to post the right content on the right platform, leading to faster growth in likes, comments, shares, and followers.

## Dataset used

## Questions (KPIs)
- On which platform (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) did Rohan receive the highest engagement (likes + shares + comments)?
- Which type of post (Video, Carousel, Image, Text, Poll) gives the highest engagement rate?
- In which month was the engagement rate highest and lowest?
- How does sentiment vary across platforms or post types?
- On which day of the week does Rohan’s audience engage the most?
- Which platform + post type combination gives the best ROI (Return on Investment) for his efforts?
