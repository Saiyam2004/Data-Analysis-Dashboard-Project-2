# Social Media Engagement Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
Rohan is an aspiring content creator who is active on multiple social media platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. Despite posting consistently, he struggles to decide which type of content (video, image, reel, story, etc.) performs best on each platform. As a result, the growth of his likes, shares, and comments has not improved as expected.

The challenge is to analyze Rohan’s 2023 social media performance data to identify the key problems affecting his engagement. By solving this, Rohan can develop a clear strategy to post the right content on the right platform, leading to faster growth in likes, comments, shares, and followers.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/Saiyam2004/Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Project-2/blob/main/Social%20Media%20Engagement.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- On which platform (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) did Rohan receive the highest engagement (likes + shares + comments)?
- Which type of post (Video, Carousel, Image, Text, Poll) gives the highest engagement rate?
- In which month was the engagement rate highest and lowest?
- How does sentiment vary across platforms or post types?
- On which day of the week does Rohan’s audience engage the most?
- Which platform + post type combination gives the best ROI (Return on Investment) for his efforts?

## Process
- Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
- Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
- Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
- Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Project Insight
- Total Posts: 100  || Total Likes: 238,181  || Total Comments: 20,266  ||  Total Shares: 41,565
- Instagram gives the highest ROI for Rohan’s effort. Twitter shows lowest engagement.
- Rohan should focus more on Video + Carousel content.
- Posting during midweek and mid-year months boosts ROI.
- Majority of followers respond positively, but negative comments are not negligible. Rohan should monitor feedback and adjust content to reduce negativity.
- Rohan should reduce low-performing formats and invest more effort into video/carousel content on Instagram.

## Final Conclusion:
The analysis clearly shows that Rohan’s growth challenge does not lie in lack of effort, but in choosing the right content for the right platform. By focusing on high-performing formats such as videos and carousels, and leveraging Instagram as the primary growth driver, Rohan can significantly accelerate his engagement. Posting strategically during midweek and optimizing content based on audience sentiment will further maximize ROI. Instead of spreading energy across low-performing platforms like Twitter, concentrating efforts on channels and formats with proven success ensures faster growth in likes, comments, shares, and followers. This data-driven strategy provides Rohan with a clear roadmap to transform his content creation journey into measurable success.
